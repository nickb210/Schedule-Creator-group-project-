# Information

This is a team project I made in my Application Programming class (CS 3443) at UTSA. Everything below this line is what we submitted for the assignment. 

# Schedule Creator

You can't get back time, you can only organize it. With the new Schedule Creator you can easily organize your daily and weekly schedule. Enter any daily events you have such as a class or work as well as non recurring events like birthdays or payment deadlines. With Schedule Creator, you'll never miss an event. 

Schedule Creator lets you enter both deadlines (such as assignments due dates/times) and blocks of time (such as classes or work hours). It will easily let you plan out your daily schedule by choosing start and end time for events, deadlines and due times, as well as other things like reminders and travel time. Easy to use, and plenty of room for more features. 

## Getting Started

First clone the Schedule Creator repository and add it to the IDE of your choice. Be sure to download JDK 8 and JavaFX if you don't already have a copy on your system. 

Once you have all the required files downloaded, running the program will take you to the main page of the application. 
On this view you will be able to either create a new schedule or view a preexisting one. 

If you choose to create a new schedule, you will be taken to the event creation screen where you can input the name, location, and other details about your time commitment. If you have your own schedule you can easily load it with a single click that'll automatically populate your weekly view. 

After you have created an event, you can view your schedule by clicking the view schedule button on the main page. This will take you to a weekly view of your schedule populated by your events. Additionally, by clicking on an event in your schedule you can view a more in-depth description of the chosen event. If you'd like a fresh start for your schedule, by clicking the "Clear Schedule" button you can completely wipe your current schedule.
